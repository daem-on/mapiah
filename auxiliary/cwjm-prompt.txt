Create the following methods for the current class:

* toMap,
* fromMap,
* fromJson,
* copyWith,
* hashCode and
* overriden == operator.

Don´t use super as base for any methods.

Include all parameters of the original class forCWJM constructor and use this same constructor in the fromMap and copyWith methods.

In case there are any optional parameters, include an extra makePARAMETER_NAMENull boolean parameter in copyWith.

toMap, toJson, copyWith, hashCode should include @override annotations.

Use jsonDecode(), not json.decode().

In the toMap() method start the map with a "'TYPE_STRING_ID': type.name". Check on the fromMap() method of the parent class for the exact TYPE_STRING_ID that should be used.

In the fromMap() method use 'Type.values.byName(map[TYPE_STRING_ID])' to get the type back from the map.

If there is a 'oppositeCommand' parameter, it should be treated as nullable.

Present only the created methods, don´t return the complete class.
